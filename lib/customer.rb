# Take customer CSV, make customer parser class.
# When you create an instance, Have parse create a method that outputs a file name (Customers.csv), and it gives back an array of customer instances (i.e., you’ll have to write a customer class as well)
# The job of customer parser is to take CSV data and turn it into data objects(Doesn't have to store data)
# Once you know how that works, go through and do the same thing with the other CSV’s.
